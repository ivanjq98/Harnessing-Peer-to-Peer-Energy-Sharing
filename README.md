Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading

Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading is the direct energy trading between prosumerconsumers and prosumers and is frequently implemented inside a local power distribution system. It was founded on the basis of the  "P2P economy" concept (also known as the sharing economy). In peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading, energy from small-scale Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in homes, offices, factories, and other facilities is exchanged between local energy prosumers and consumers. Peer-to-peer energy trading's key advantage is that it does away with the need for any middlemen, allowing consumers and prosumers to transact at a lower cost because they are not responsible for covering the intermediary's fees.

Block-chain technology

Blockchain is a method for storing data that makes it difficult or impossible for the system to be changed, hacked, or used improperly. A distributed ledger known as a blockchain distributes and copies transactions throughout the network of computers involved. Blockchain technology is a system for keeping public transactional records across numerous databases in a network connected by peer-to-peer nodes (also referred to as "blocks"). The term "digital ledger" is widely used to describe this kind of storage. The owner's digital signature serves as both a validation and fraud prevention mechanism for every transaction in this ledger. It also serves to authenticate the transaction. The information in the digital ledger is therefore extremely secure. The three key advantages of blockchain technology are that it is decentralized, automated and highly secure.

Project Objectives

Peer-to-Peer energy trading system which includes a blockchain network, virtual auctions and implementation of smart contracts for energy trading transactions. The final objective is integrating both systems together to simulate the interaction of the supply from microgrid power with demand from consumers from the energy trading platform. This would be done using the hardware microgrid in the Clean Energy Research Lab (CERL).

Project Summary
The idea of this project is to do energy trading between the consumer and prosumers to secure transactions when they meet the demand through the real-time simulation program. 
Electricity is an essential part of modern life for operating appliances, computers, electronics, machinery and public transportation systems. Energy trading comes with a supply and demand to meet the buyer and seller needs. The modern channel to perform  in energy trading is transact payment manually using cash and credit card transactions. However, there are some contradictions in using credit card transactions. For example, a typical Visa transaction generally involves a few parties, such as the credit card network, the financial institution that enables merchants to receive payment from the buyer, the cardholder bank, the merchant and the individual cardholder. 

Each party involved in the process changes other parties' fee, which results in effectively raising the prices for buyers to make the payment to reach the merchant which is known as the seller for the energy trading. Nowadays, the advancement of technology is easily accessible to retrieve the card numbers for the hackers to steal, especially the information that is kept under the merchantâ€™s (seller) record. These problems where the criminal skimmed the victim card details to create a cloned card with their data involving financial transactions for the purpose of personal gain. 
Hence, there is a better solution to prevent the personal information retrieved by the hacker and reduce the effective cost of energy trading. Hence, this project focuses on implementing the Peer-to-Peer Energy (P2P) trading system.  

Exploration of Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading System
--------------------------------------------------
The P2P trading enabled mutual beneficial interactions among prosumers and consumers for energy exchange. This allows  prosumers to sell their power to nearby consumers without the requirement for a distributor. This system used the blockchain technology and consensus approach to ensure that every transaction was confirmed. The energy trading platform of this project was established to set up a local private blockchain. There are different types of approaches to setting up the blockchain network, such as Proof of Authority (PoA) and Proof of Stake (PoS).  The PoA as our consensus method that supplies the ability to set the gas price to 0 without any transaction fee between the participants (prosumer and consumer). The benefits of PoA can be to disclose the identity of authorities to verify transactions and build new blocks. Hence, the system does not require hardware to maintain the network.
